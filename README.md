# Somnium, the Horror Game supplemented by AI
>*During Fall 2022 I wanted to engage in a project that put my game development skills to the test as part of my Senior Design class. The result was a horror game that adapted to the player's state using a facial recognition artificial intelligence to categorize emotions. It was done by a team of 5 as we learned a myriad of skills on the fly during that year: rendering, level design, player psychology, composition, and many more.*

>*The changes made in the `Main` branch were the fruits of our efforts, with the changes done in the `ExperimentalFeatures` branch by me during after our submission to the board of professors assigned to critique it. To say that this project is solely a labor of love is an understatement, as I would personally regard it as more of a testament to the efforts put forth by its team to achieve their ambitions.*

>_Many thanks to **Grant Allen**, **Troy Crawford**, **Nicole Freites**, and **Steve Jacques**, who all contributed to Somniuma and help me realize this project._

## Objective
The player must navigate the ever-changing rooms of this nightmare house whilst avoiding manifestations of their nightmares throughout; by locating the key hidden somewhere within the house, the player may then escape on the 1st-floor through the right-most door and be free from the nightmares that plague them. But tread cautiously, as the creatures that live within this dreamscape would rather you become a permanent guest in their home...
